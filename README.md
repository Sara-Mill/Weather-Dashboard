# Weather-Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard I made based off of a mock up.
It uses local Storage to store data, and Open Weather Map API to poulate the fields.

It still needs to be amended with search history, it currently only stores one city.

It also needs to have a function added that clears the search history when the user refreshes the page.

But it does show the current weather for a city, as well as a five day forecast for that searched city.
